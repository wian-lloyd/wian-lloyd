### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I'm Wian
I make tonnes of junk pretty often.
Some of it is good junk.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an awesome property management system with some friends at Noldor.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning too much.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything I can.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Slack/Discord.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: There was a successful Tinder match in Antarctica in 2014.
