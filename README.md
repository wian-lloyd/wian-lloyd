**I'm Wian.**
<br>
I make tonnes of junk pretty often.
<br>
Some of it is good junk.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an awesome property management system with some friends at Noldor.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React, Next.js & Mantine.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m not current looking to collaborate, working on lots.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Slack/Discord.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: A single computer program detects over half of all Wikipedia vandalism with more than 90% precision.
