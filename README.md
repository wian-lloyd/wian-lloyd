**I'm Wian.**
<br>
I make tonnes of junk pretty often.
<br>
Some of it is good junk.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an awesome system with some friends at Noldor.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Flutter and Dart.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m not currently looking to collaborate.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: Check my website!
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: A single computer program detects over half of all Wikipedia vandalism with more than 90% precision.
